sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: When the file is sorted the algorithm takes almost the same time as the merge sort but with other files takes longer.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: This is the most efficient with lowers execution times than the others. However, the execution time is bigger with the files in reverse order because the algorithm has to sort more values.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:  The execution time on this algorithm is identical no matter which file is being sorted which indicates that the algorithm takes the same number of steps.
